In this course, students will focus on advanced concepts in object-oriented programming, using the Java programming language. Specifically, the programs that students develop will support typical business-processing activities. Advanced concepts related to using inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces will be presented in the course. Students will also build applications that utilize graphical user interfaces to process user inputs and outputs and focus on advanced programming concepts, such as recursion, sorting, and the Java collections framework.
